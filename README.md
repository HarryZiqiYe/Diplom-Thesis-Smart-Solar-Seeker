# Smart-Solar-Seeker

Abstract

The paper hand in deals with the tracking of the sun, which follows the position of the sun, to get the maximum efficiency. Solar technology is a renewable energy source, that contributes to a sustainable environment. In contrast to flat lying solar panels, it is possible to produce more energy through tracking. A prototype has been developed and constructed which performs mostly all our tasks that we need.

Most of the mechanical components are standard aluminum profiles which are mainly used for the framework of our system, which can withstand weather and physical influences.
Furthermore, the project covers the implementation of a control algorithm on a microcontroller.
An GPS unit and light sensors have been used, which represents the input data of our algorithm. Two actuators, which have been installed, are controlled by the algorithm which are supposed to bring the solar panel to the the best solar radiation. The group compares with the measurements taken how economical it is to track and if it is necessary to rotate on two axes. An ESP32 microcontroller is used in the project and programmed with C++. Some circuit boards have been designed and implanted for our regulation of the supply voltage and for control of actuators, which uses inductors, relays, resistors, and other specific electronical components.
